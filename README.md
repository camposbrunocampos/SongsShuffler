# SongsShuffler

This is a sample project where the idea is to explore some of the Android jetpack components, like LiveData and ViewModel.
The idea here is also to explore how tests would fit with the jetpack components and the MVVM architecture.
In order to explore this, an app where the main idea is to list some songs from one API was developed.
The app also has a feature which shuffles the songs, this algorithm follows the following rules:
1) The algorithm needs to generate different list of songs in each execution.
2) Same artists songs should not appear together.
